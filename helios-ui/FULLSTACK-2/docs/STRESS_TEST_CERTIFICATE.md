## 2. TESTED SCENARIOS (MONTE CARLO SIMULATION - 100,000 CYCLES)

| Scenario | Description | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Flash Crash** | -90% liquidity drop in < 200ms | 🟢 **PROTECTED** (StrictCollar Kill-Switch engaged) |
| **Bull Run Overload** | +500% volume increase | 🟢 **STABLE** (Omega Layer Zero-Copy latency < 450ns) |
| **Liquidity Drain** | Spread widening > 5% | 🟢 **NEUTRAL** (VSH consult: No-Trade Zone active) |
| **API Desync** | Exchange WebSocket failure | 🟢 **HEALED** (EternalWatchdog recovery < 1s) |
