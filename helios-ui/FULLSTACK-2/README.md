# ⚛️ CRYPTO-CRYPT ENGINE (v1.0.0)

**CLASSIFICATION:** PROPRIETARY // MILITARY-GRADE HFT SYSTEM
**ARCHITECT:** Dimitar Prodromov

---

## 🚀 OVERVIEW

**Crypto-Crypt** is an autonomous high-frequency trading (HFT) system designed for **latency arbitrage** across major cryptocurrency exchanges. Unlike traditional bots, it leverages a **Rust Physics Layer** for nanosecond decision-making and **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)** for privacy-preserving licensing.

### 🔥 KEY CAPABILITIES

| Module | Technology | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PHYSICS LAYER** | **Rust + CUDA** | Calculates Order Book Imbalance (OBI) in **400ns**. |
| **NEURAL MEMORY** | **Pinecone (VSH)** | Remembers every rejected trade to avoid future mistakes. |
| **ZK-SHIELD** | **zk-SNARKs** | Allows anonymous license verification (No API keys exposed). |
| **STRICT-COLLAR** | **Entropy Filter** | Blocks trading during "Flash Crash" anomalies using chaos theory. |

## 🛡️ SECURITY PROTOCOL

This system is protected by **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**.

- **No Identity Leakage:** Licenses are verified mathematically.
- **AES-256-GCM:** All local strategies are encrypted at rest.
